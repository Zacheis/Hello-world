# Hello-world
Just another repository
Hello, my name is Aaron. I have no idea what I am doing and just wanted to give this a try to see if this is something I would want to pursue it further. I made this accoun to accompany my FreeCodeCamp account. I am more than willing to learn and be taught. Looking forward to all the help. Talk to you soon.
